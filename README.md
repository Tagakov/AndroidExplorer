Spans allow decorating text.

SpannableString#setSpan - start param inclusive, end param exclusive.

Spannable flags (SPAN_INCLUSIVE_INCLUSIVE and etc). If inclusive then text inserted at the border position is spanned, if exclusive then it is not spanned.

We can insert as much text as we want (spans will be applied to them).
